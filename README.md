# Q-A_App

This is just a test app to get used to using the Auth0 service. It is a simple Q & A App. 
If a user is not logged in they can only view the questions and answers that are already saved in the database.
A user can log in via GitHub, Google, Or Facebook.
Only a user that is logged in can ask and answer a question.

## Test on Local
For this application React, Nodejs, and Express were used.
To run locally do a yarn install for both frontend and backend directory to insall all needed dependencies.
Run yarn server to start up the backend on the backend directory.
Then, Run yarn start on the frontend directory to start up the React App.

## Disclaimer
This is just a test application so there still may be a few glitches in the app. The idea of this application was for educational purposes.
